# peelgroupbenefits
Custom website built for a group benefits company.
This website was built using the Materialze CSS library. The emphasis of this site was to create an attractive UI/UX which would entice the user to book an appointment. A cool feature within this website, allows them to book apointments by sending an email. This feature was done using Mailgun and their API to send emails. 
I also used a little bit of expressjs to create routes and handle different urls.
