        <h5 class="title">Short Term Disability Insurance</h5>
        <p>
          Short Term Disability protection (STD) is designed to provide immediate
          income replacement benefits to employees unable to work due to an injury or illness.
          Short Term Disability benefits are typically payable for 4 – 6 months, coinciding with
          Long Term Disability waiting periods.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is often an employer paid benefit and, as a result,
          is usually taxable in the hands of the disabled employee. The benefit replaces a percentage of
          the employee’s weekly earnings up to a specified maximum. Once the end of the coverage period
          has been reached, an employee would be transitioned to Long Term Disability coverage as long as they continue to meet the definition of total disability.
        </p>
        <p>With Short Term Disability coverage in place, employers are able to apply for an Employment Insurance (EI) premium reduction.</p>

        <h5 class="title">Long Term Disability Insurance</h5>
        <p>
          Group Long Term Disability coverage (LTD) provides plan members with replacement
          income in the event of a disability caused by an illness or accident occurring
          on or off the job. If a plan member is unable to work due to a disability, a
          percentage of income is payable monthly following the elimination period.
          These monthly income replacement benefits allow a plan member to provide for the basic necessities and maintain their standard of living.

        <p>
          Claims management services and employee assistance benefits are commonly included in your Group Insurance Plan when LTD is selected.
          These programs are designed to assist companies dealing with an employee on disability claim and to help a disabled employee return
          to work in a timely manner.

        <p>
          As a business owner or high income earner, your disability insurance needs are unique.
          An individual disability insurance policy can supplement your group LTD benefits by providing access to
          higher coverage amounts and options that allow for a higher degree of customization.
        </p>
        <p>
          See Individual Disability Insurance for more details on supplementing your disability benefits.
