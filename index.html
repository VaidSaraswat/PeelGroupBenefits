      <h4 class="title">Flexibility and Stability</h4>
      <p>Group Benefit Plans also known as Employee Benefits have become flexible and creative.
        They are more than just drug and dental benefits coverage. They now offer broad coverage featuring healthcare,
        dental care, disability benefits, group life insurance, accidental death and dismemberment and more.
        Your Group Benefit Plan is a key attraction for recruiting and retaining top valuable employees as it is viewed as an “addition to salary” to them and their family members.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the employer sponsoring the plan it is important to find the best insurance company or companies who will underwrite and service your program. We look for flexibility in underwriting, financial stability and a proven record of claims handling and service. Your business is unique,
        so too are your needs for the benefit plan. We are here to find you the right fit for both plan and plan provider.

      <p>
        We will meet with you and your human resources department to determine all your needs,
        offer solution and ideas in a plan design and submit to the insurance companies and coordinate on your behalf.
        An annual "Plan Review" is vital to ensuring that your current Group Benefits Plan continues to meet its requirements and objectives for you.
        We prepare an annual report chronicling your group’s claims experience during the previous policy term,
        and detail the rate structure the insurance company proposes for the coming policy year.
        We finalize that with our summary recommendations and solutions and help you in deciding if any plan additions or
        amendments should be taken and we implement those for you.

          Designing flexible benefit plans (or flex) plans which offer more than
          one standard package of benefit options giving plan members a choice and options
           that are best for them and their family.

        <li>
          Health spending accounts which can be added to a flex plan providing members
          credits that can be applied to health care expenses which may not be covered
          by their Group Benefit Plan.

          Integration of insured benefits with statutory benefits (example: CPP/QPP, WSIB, EI etc.)
          These are all solutions that can offer you more unique tailored benefits for your business and employees.
