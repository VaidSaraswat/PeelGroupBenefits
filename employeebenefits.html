        <b><h4 class="title">Employee group benefits plan</h4></b>
        <p>
          For most entrepreneurs, running their own business can be a personally satisfying experience,
          but not without its challenges. Small business owners, in particular, worry about attracting
          the talent they need to succeed, as experienced people are hard to find and entice away from bigger companies.
          Offering the same perks can be a stretch for many small business owners who grapple with tight budget constraints.
        </p>

        <h5 class="title">What about existing employees?</h5>

        <p>
          Keeping them happy is also a priority, but the question is, how? Many employers use salary increases
          to compensate employees for a job well done but are there any other options to reward strong performance?
          A group benefits plan may be the answer.
        </p>

        <h5 class="title">A tax-effective way to compensate employees</h5>
        <p>For the employee, a salary increase is impacted up-front by a variety of payroll taxes and employee income taxes.
          However, with a group benefits plan, employees in all provinces except Quebec receive health and dental benefits
          tax-free and employer contributions are deductible as a business expense.
        </p>

    <div class="col 12 m12 l6">
      <div class="container">
        <h4 class="title">The hidden costs</h4>
        <p>To give an employee $1,000 more in salary, the employer must also factor in payroll taxes such as:</p>
        <ul class="browser-default">
          <li>Canada Pension Plan/Quebec Pension Plan (CPP/QPP)</li>
          <li>Employment Insurance (EI)</li>
          <li>Workers’ Compensation</li>
          <li>Employer Health Tax (Ontario)</li>
          <li>and others.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In addition, the employee has to contribute their portion of some of the payroll taxes, such as CPP/QPP and EI.</p>
        <h5 class="title">Get more out of each compensation dollar</h5>
        <p>
          As an alternative to an increase in salary, the employer could put that $1,000 towards the premium for a
          health and dental insurance plan and all of the $1,000 goes to the plan – to the benefit of the employee.
          Provincial sales tax* and premium tax are charged on the plan’s premiums,
          but this tax burden is still less than the payroll taxes charged on salary.
        </p>
        <p>*Provincial sales tax only applicable in Ontario and Quebec.</p>

    <div class="col s12">
      <div class="container">
        <h4 class="center title">Points to consider</h4>
        <ul class="browser-default">
          <li>In Ontario and Quebec, the employer's cost of insurance would be impacted by provincial sales tax.</li>
          <li>The cost of health insurance includes carrier administration expenses and fees.</li>
          <li>The above example is for a health and dental plan.
            Employer contributions to a life plan are a taxable benefit to the employee,
            and benefits from an LTD plan are only tax-free if fully funded by the employee.
          </li>
          <li>Individual tax rates vary by income and province.</li>
          <li>Applicable payroll taxes vary by province, and some such as CPP and EI have maximum contribution levels.</li>
          <li>In Quebec, tax savings from a benefits plan would be on the federal tax portion,
            since health plans are taxable benefits for Quebec provincial income tax.
          </li>
          <li>Depending on the situation, the employer may choose to consult with their tax advisor for additional information.</li>
        </ul>

    </div>

    <div class="col s12">
      <div class="container">
        <h4 class="center title">Employees appreciate their benefit plans</h4>
        <p>
          Not only is a group benefits plan a tax-effective use of compensation dollars,
          employee satisfaction with their plans is very high. According to the 2011 sanofi-aventis Healthcare Survey, if
          given a choice, 59% of respondents would keep their health benefits rather than receive an extra $10,000 cash payment per year
