      <h4 class="title">Why should I as an Employer install a Group Insurance plan?</h4>
      <p>
        First of all, you are an employee also. We would think that you and your family would want or need benefits also. Most employees would like to have benefits, and are prepared to pay something toward them. Yes, you can pay 100% of the monthly premium, but with CRA rules, the employees should at least pay for the Life Insurance, A.D. & D. and Dependent Life so that if there is ever a claim, the Beneficiary gets the funds tax-free. The same is true for Short term Disability and Long Term Disability.
      </p>

      <p>
        The other important reason is that if you are hiring employees, especially another key management employee, it is good to have a Group Plan. The person you are interviewing probably has/had a Plan where they were working previously

    <div class="container white-text">
      <h4 class="title">What does a good Benefits plan include?</h4>
      <p>
        While the Benefits plan must include Group Life, A.D.& D. and Dependent Life, the two most important benefits for most employees are Health and Dental. The must include benefits are very inexpensive, but the most desirable two are much more expensive. The Health benefit includes Prescription Drugs, Travel Insurance, Para medic Practitioners, Private Duty nursing, Hearing Aids, assistive devices like rental of wheelchairs, etc. The Dental plan includes cleanings and fillings, gum treatment, and check-ups every 6 or 9 months. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Some Plans also include Long Term Disability Insurance, This benefit pays a percentage of an employee's monthly earnings due to accident or sickness, on or off the job. If the employee pays the premium for this benefit, it is received tax-free. 
      </p>
      <p>
        There are other optional benefits such as Semi-Private Hospital, Vision Care and Critical Illness Insurance available.

      <h4 class="title">Are there things you can do to my Benefits Plan during COVID-19?</h4>
      <p>
        Yes, there are some things to consider if you have lay-off employees, or reduce the earnings of those that are still employed. First, if you have earnings related Group Life Insurance and A.D. & D. and the personal earnings decrease then you can notify the Group Insurer. They will reduce the coverage and you will have lower monthly premiums for those benefits. Secondly, you can reduce the number of Paramedical practitioners inside your Health benefit, and that should help lower you premium.

      <h4 class="title">Should my Group Plan include Disability Insurance benefits?</h4>
      <p>
        You can be the major judge of this! What would happen if you had a fall or a major illness, and you had to stay home from work, where would your income come from? Most employees do not carry personal Disability Insurance. Depending on the occu pations in your company, the premiums through the L.T.D. benefit are a lot lower than those for the personal disability insurance. Also, the non-medical maximum under the Group Plan is reasonable, and does not require Evidence of Insurability.

      <h4 class="title">Can I discontinue Dental Benefits because Dentists are not seeing patients currently?</h4>
      <p>
        With the current COVID-19 crisis, the Dentists are not open to see their patients. Some employers are dropping the benefit for at least two to three months, or at least until the epidemic subsides. This would definitely save you monthly premium. We also ask you to keep in mind the fact that when things "quiet down", and you reinstall the benefit, there will be a rush on the use of this benefit. This would, of course, affect the future rates at the next Renewal review.

    <div class="container white-text">
      <h4 class="title">What Health benefits appeal to Employees, and how expensive are they?</h4>
      <p>
        The main Health benefits that appeal to most employees are the Prescription Drugs, the Paramedical Practitioners, and the Emergency Travel Insurance. If you were given a prescription by your Doctor, especially one you have to take for the rest of your life, that could definitely add up in the long run. Usually, there is a reimbursement percentage, say 80%, to help keep the premium down. The Paramedical benefit usually has a maximum for each practitioner, say $500. Again, most Plans reimburse 80%.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Emergency Travel Insurance is for coverage while travelling, even in Canada, but mostly for travelling out of the country. The reimbursement level is 100%. Normally, there is a maximum number of days for any one travel period, say 60 days, as well as per trip dollar maximum, or lifetime maximum

    <div class="container white-text">
      <h4 class="title">Are there ways of offering more flexible Benefits?</h4>
      <p>
        Yes! You can, for your Health and Dental claims, use a Health Spending Account (HSA). The amount you can allow for each employee can be the same for all employees, or you can vary the amounts by Class of employee i.e. Management, All Others, etc. These amounts and the charges are considered a business expense for CRA purposes. Sometimes, if you have only the Health benefit, and wish to add Dental, then this method would allow you to control the costs.

      <h4 class="title">What happens to my Plan at its Annual Renewal?</h4>
      <p>
        The Group Insurer looks to see if there is change of age for the Life Insurance. Dependent Life, and Long Term Disability Insurance benefits, up or down. They also review your Health and Dental Paid Claims versus the premium you have paid. When we were marketing your Plan, we would have shown you the Target Loss Ratio for Each of the companies that quoted. Then, together with the Trend Factor (like a cost of living), they compare them to the Paid Loss Ratios, This is how your benefit gets a decrease or increase in monthly premium. Our job, as your Benefits Broker, is to negotiate these changes.

    <div class="container white-text">
      <h4 class="title">Do I have to put all my employees on the Group Benefits Plan?</h4>
      <p>
        When you are first signing up for a Group Insurance Plan, and the premium is being shared with the employees, you are required to have at least 75% of all eligible employees join the Plan. If you, the Employer, is paying 100% of the premium, then 100% of the eligible employees must join the Plan. "Eligible" means having worked for you, say at least 3 months, the employee works at least 20 hours per week, and is considered "a full-time employee".
      </p>
    </div>
  </section>
  
  <section class="section cyan">
    <div class="container white-text">
      <h4 class="title">How many Group Insurance Companies do you use when marketing?</h4>
      <p>
        We use all of the Group carriers who quote on that number of employees in the 
        company e.g. two companies for two employees, eight companies for three or more employees, etc. There are a couple of companies who only quote on 25 or more employees. We provide you with a spreadsheet for all of the companies who quoted.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you have an existing Plan, then all of the insurers require up to your last three years of Claims Experience and premium rates for those years.
